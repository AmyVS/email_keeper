#Email Keeper

Welcome to my Email Keeper. This project helped me to understand how Ruby object orientation works.
Email Keeper is just what the name suggests - it's a tool for keeping track of contacts and their
associated email addresses. Hope you find it handy!

##Installation
Down in the bottom right where it says "HTTPS clone URL", just click on the little clipboard
icon to copy the address. Hop on over to your command line, type "git clone" and paste the copied
address. That should give you a copy of all the files.

Once you have all the files, just type "ruby email_keeper.rb" in your command line to run the
program and you should be good to go. Thanks for checking out my project!
